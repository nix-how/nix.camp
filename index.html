      Accommodation will be provided by the <a href="https://astralship.org">Astralship</a>, a hackerspace that
      promotes creativity, collaboration and innovation located in Deiniolen, Wales.

        The Astralship is based in a 200 year old chapel, where the mountains of
        Snowdonia meet the sea. The chapel dates from 1838 and is located in an
        unbelievably beautiful area, with endless mountains, beaches and quarries
        to explore. It's the perfect place to be if you like hiking, climbing and

    <h2 id="about">What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      The Summer of Nix is a two month train & work project that will take place
      between <emph>August 2nd to October 15th 2021</emph>. It is made for anyone
      who wants to rapidly increase their Nix skills while doing useful work for
      the Nix and the wider FOSS community - all of this together in a remote
      team and getting paid a nice stipend. After the program, there will be
      opportunities for continued work as paid freelance contractor with the
      NixOS foundation.

    <h2>Who is organizing this, and why?</h2>
    <p>
      The program is funded via the European Comission's Next Generation Internet
      Initiative and organized by members of the core Nix development team, the
      <img style="display: inline;height:1rem;width:auto;transform:translateY(0.2rem);" src="images/logo.png"></img>
      <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS foundation</a>,

      <img style="display: inline;height:1rem;width:auto;transform:translateY(0.2rem);" src="images/tweag.png"></img>
      <a href="https://tweag.io">Tweag</a>. The wider goal is to <emph>establish
        Nix as one of the principal platforms for free and open source software</emph>.
      Concretely, this means packaging many free and open programs, and improving
      the general packaging situation in Nix. The program is set up to train up
      to 30 participants to become at ease in the Nix ecosystem and to deliver as
      many packages as possible from a list of strategic projects.

  <div class="item text">
    <h2>For whom is this interesting?</h2>
    <p>
      This program is <emph>great for students, professionals or
        passionates</emph> who can spend the time over summer to rapidly increase
      their Nix skills while doing useful, paid work. What we need from you
      is commitment, motivation for two months of full time work and basic Nix
      knowledge. You should know what a nix shell is, the basics of nixpkgs and
      the language, as explained in the
      <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills">nix pills</a> tutorials, for
      example. Of course, also a reasonably fast computer and internet connection
      is required although we might be able to provide some cloud infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <emph>Experienced Nix packagers are also welcome to participate in a
        mentoring role</emph> that involves reviewing, helping out with questions,
      direct individual mentoring, and also hands-on packaging. Mentoring is a
      flexible part time role, approximately equivalent to 1 day of work per
      week. If you are interesting in spreading Nix knowledge and also enjoy
      light-weight team organization, this role is for you!

    <h2>Time Zones</h2>
    <p>
      The program is open to applicants from <emph>all time zones and countries</emph>.
      Although many members of the organization committee are based in Europe,
      training sessions and workshops will be adjusted as good as possible to
      work for the majority of participants and flexible arrangements will be
      found for others.

    <h2>Compensation</h2>
    <p>
      The compensation for participants is fixed to a <emph>base stipend of 2750
        Euro</emph> in all member states of the European Union and associated
      countries like Norway, the UK and Switzerland. Elsewhere, this base is
      adjusted with a factor taking into account purchasing power parity similar
      to the GSoC program. The precise stipend amounts will be communicated
      individually to succesful applicants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mentors will be paid aligned to standard contracts with the NixOS
      foundation and details will be communicated individually.
