    <p>
      First, 3 days of intense hacking at <a href="https://birkenhack.org">BirkenHack</a> in Birkenhead, Hamilton Square, with lots of ethernet. Where attendees
      are expected to find their own accomodation in Birkenhead, or Liverpool which is close by.

      Trains to and from Liverpool are frequent and available until 11:40PM, and there are plenty of things to see on the Wirral Peninsula.

      We will visit DoES Liverpool (another local co-working/hackspace), Hilbre Island and Birkenhead Park
    </p>

      <i>
        Hamilton Square is a town square in Birkenhead, Wirral, England. The Georgian
        square, which was designed by Edinburgh architect James Gillespie Graham, has
        the most Grade I listed buildings outside London (after Trafalgar Square). It
        is named after the family of the wife of Scottish shipbuilder William Laird.

      Secondly, we will spend 5 days at the
      Astral Ship where 8 rooms are available for on-site accomodation, and are
      covered by the more expensive ticket option, which is limited in supply.

      We will head for the Astral Ship venue on the 30th, and sleep there that
      night, in case you have booked the accomodation ticket option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accommodation will be provided by the <a href="https://astralship.org">Astralship</a>, a hackspace that
      promotes creativity, collaboration and innovation located in Deiniolen, Wales.

        <i>
        The Astralship is based in a 200 year old chapel, where the mountains of
        Snowdonia meet the sea. The chapel dates from 1838 and is located in an
        unbelievably beautiful area, with endless mountains, beaches and quarries
        to explore. It's the perfect place to be if you like hiking, climbing and
        wild swimming.

    <p>
      There are many AirBNB and hotel offerings available in the surrounding
      area if this arrangement does not suit you, or full accomodation tickets
      are out of stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Food will still be provided to those who choose not to stay overnight at
      the venue, as this cost is included in the ticket price.
